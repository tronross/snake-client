# Snake Client Project

Snake is a very popular video game,  where the player maneuvers a dot (the head of the snake) and the snake grows by ‘eating’ pieces of food. The growing snake becomes an obstacle to itself. The goal is to grow it to become as big as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which it dies.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from [here](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/snek-multiplayer).
